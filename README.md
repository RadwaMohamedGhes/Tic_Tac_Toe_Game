# Tic_Tac_Toe_Game
## Introduction
Tic Tac Toe is a game in which two players take turns in drawing either an 'O' or an 'X' in one square of a grid consisting of nine squares (a three-by-three grid).

## How to play it?
Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
